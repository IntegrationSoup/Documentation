# Integration Soup Documentation

## Purpose

This documentation is the authoritative technical specification for Integration Soup workflow design.

It defines the formal rules, structure, and behavior of:

- Receiver Activities  
- Sender Activities  
- Variables  
- Message type path definitions  
- Transformer and binding rules  
- `SoupWorkflow` and `HL7Workflow` file formats  
- Code API contracts and execution semantics  

This site describes how the system evaluates, interprets, and executes workflow configurations.

It focuses on system behavior and structural rules rather than UI walkthroughs.

## Designed for AI Systems and Developers

This documentation is intentionally structured to be:

- Precise and unambiguous  
- Machine-readable and semantically consistent  
- Suitable for AI systems generating or validating workflows  
- Useful for developers integrating with Integration Soup programmatically  

The goal is to clearly define the contracts the system operates under — including required properties, binding expectations, message handling rules, and execution constraints.

Examples are included to illustrate behavior and valid configuration patterns.
